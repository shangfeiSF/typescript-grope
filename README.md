# typescript-grop

## Start

`cd path/to/typescript-grope`

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Recommand

WebStorm supports file-watcher to compile .ts to .js when coding. It is more important for me that Webstorm also tips all the error message when coding

You can install Webstorm and press `command + ,` to open the preferences panel and then search `typescript` to config your file-watcher about typescript
